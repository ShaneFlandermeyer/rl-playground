# rl-playground
A simple repository to help new students get started with RL and Gym/Gymnasium

## Setup instructions

* Pull this repository to some directory on your local machine

* Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), a convenient tool for managing dependencies in Python environments, by running the following in your command line of choice.

```[bash]
pip install poetry
```

* In your terminal, change into the directory for this project. For example, in my linux desktop, I installed the project in ```/home/shane/src/```, so I would run

```[bash]
cd /home/shane/src/rl-playground/
```

* Initialize the virtual environment with poetry

```[bash]
poetry shell
poetry install
```

* If the command above runs successfully, you should be ready to start doing reinforcement learning!
